# TXN-0 Automation Flows (Project Overview)

This repository contains the orchestration flows and documentation for **TXN-0**, an automation-native system built with **n8n + LLMs**.  
The system ingests user-submitted stories (via Google Form on [txn0.io](https://txn0.io)), validates them, and sends **symbolic on-chain acknowledgements**, while posting commentary to Telegram and X.

This repo is published as a technical reference — not as a promotion — to share how AI + workflow tools can be combined for real, auditable automation.

## 🧠 What It Does

- **Story Intake** → Google Form (embedded on [txn0.io](https://txn0.io)) ➜ Google Sheets queue  
- **AI Validation** → LLM scoring for relevance, duplication, and low-signal entries  
- **Wallet Handling** → checksum + deduplication against `wallet-log.json`  
- **Airdrop Engine** → sequential symbolic token sends with logging  
- **Ledger Logging** → JSON file log as an off-chain mirror for auditability  
- **Cross-Posting** → Telegram + X commentary with TX hash + truncated wallet details  
- **Ops** → runs on Contabo VPS (Ubuntu) with cron-based backups and hardened `.env`

---

## 🔒 Safety & Guardrails

- **Sequential gate** → processes one row at a time (prevents double-sends).  
- **Human-in-loop (Telegram)** → optional approve/reject gate for edge cases.  
- **Social logic** → strict filters; most branches return `SKIP` to avoid spam.  
- **Transparency** → public X posts mirror BscScan TX hashes for every drop.

## 📊 Outputs in the Wild

Example X commentary (generated by the system):

> The Glitch Engine TXN0FIED another wallet.  
> Airdrop: 1,000 TXNF → 0xF83d…8127  
> Proof: [0xb1dd57cb00…](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb1dd57cb00...)

Each drop creates a verifiable trail: **submission ➜ validation ➜ chain TX ➜ public post ➜ ledger entry**.

## 🧩 Dependencies

- **n8n** → Node-based automation platform  
- **OpenAI API** → GPT-4/mini for validation, scoring, and copywriting  
- **Telegram Bot API** → approvals, alerts, and story moderation  
- **Google Sheets API** → intake + queue (story submissions, tracking)  
- **Local JSON ledger** → persistent file-based wallet log  
- **X (Twitter) API** → replies, likes, RT, and announcement posts  
- **Contabo VPS (Ubuntu)** → host with hardened `.env` and cron backups  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Flow JSONs not included (contain secrets/PII) — only screenshots.  
- Scaling beyond a few hundred concurrent rows not yet tested.  
- Current deduplication logic works but could be hardened further.  
- On-chain posting involves gas costs; economics not optimized at large scale.
