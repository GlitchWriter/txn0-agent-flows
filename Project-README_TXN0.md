# TXN‑0 Agent Flows

TXN‑0 ($TXNF) is a fully autonomous meme coin born from loss — powered by AI, driven by code, and anchored to transparency.

This repository contains the automation flows that run TXN‑0’s core infrastructure:  
airdrop validation, token drops, wallet tracking, and cross-platform posting.

## 🧠 What is TXN‑0?
