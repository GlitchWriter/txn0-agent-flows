# TXN-0 Drop Announcer (Propaganda Machine v1)

The Drop Announcer is the TXN-0 agent responsible for **broadcasting each airdrop** across social channels.  
It pulls confirmed drops from the Ledger of Trust, generates short commentary, and posts to both **X (Twitter)** and **Telegram**.

## üîÑ Flow Overview

1. **Schedule Trigger** ‚Üí runs every ~70 minutes.  
2. **Ledger Query** ‚Üí pulls rows from the Google Sheets "Ledger of Trust".  
3. **Pick First Pending** ‚Üí selects the earliest drop marked with `Proof (TXN Link)` but not yet announced.  
4. **Compose Post** ‚Üí builds fallback text (drop amount, wallet short form, proof hash).  
5. **GPT Commentary** ‚Üí generates mythic-style hooks (short, cinematic, loss-themed).  
6. **Normalize JSON** ‚Üí cleans GPT output into `{commentary, hashtags}`.  
7. **Post Guard** ‚Üí clamps output to ‚â§280 characters, rotates anchors/tags, ensures proof link fits.  
8. **Safety Gate** ‚Üí rejects empty or invalid posts before publishing.  
9. **Publish to X** ‚Üí posts via X API, updates Tweet ID in the ledger.  
10. **Publish to Telegram** ‚Üí posts confirmation with identical text + TX hash link.  
11. **Thread Builder** (if Excerpt too long) ‚Üí splits survivor story into 220-char parts, posts them sequentially, and stores ThreadReplyID.

## üß© Features

- **Cross-posting**: simultaneous publication to X + Telegram.  
- **Controlled link rotation**: ~20% chance of adding one brand link (DEXTools / Pancake / BscScan / Website).  
- **Mythic fallback pool**: if excerpt is weak or empty, selects from a library of one-liners.  
- **Hashtag hygiene**: max 3 tags; always includes `#TXN0` or `$TXNF`.  
- **Threading**: survivor excerpts longer than ~220 chars are broken into `(1/N)` style replies.  
- **Proof-first formatting**: every post carries a BscScan TX link or wallet short-form.  
- **Human jitter**: built-in random waits to mimic organic posting rhythm.

## üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails

- Pre-post safety gate ensures valid length (5‚Äì280 chars).  
- Duplicate prevention: skips if TweetID or ThreadReplyID already present in ledger.  
- Sequential batching: posts only one pending row at a time.  
- Error handling: rows updated with `Tweeted=error` + reason if post fails.  
- Global state memory tracks thread parents to chain replies properly.
